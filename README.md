DIY Pocket Piano
==============================
This started as a fork of the Critter and Guitari Arduino Pocket Piano which used to be a synth on an Arduino shield that you could buy from them. The shield is no longer made so I ordered some PCBs and all the necessary bits and pieces. Once assessmbled I started to mess with the code to add increased functionality. 

Files are as follows: 
1) CG_* files are the original Critter and Guitari files
2) CG_PCB is the original PCB from Critter and Guitari
3) SimplePlay_w_Function_Text has a simple synth along with text and function key working
4) SimplePlay_and_OctaveArp_Working is a working sketch that has text and two modes on it. 
5) SimplePlay_and_OctaveArp is a sketch I am messing with to add more features.
