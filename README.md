DIY Pocket Piano
==============================
This started as a fork of the Critter and Guitari Arduino Pocket Piano which used to be a synth on an Arduino shield that you could buy from them. The shield is no longer made so I ordered some PCBs and all the necessary bits and pieces. Once assessmbled I started to mess with the code to add increased functionality.
